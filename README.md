# Course-recommendation-system
This project focuses on recommending courses using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and cosine similarity. 
The system suggests relevant courses based on similarities in course descriptions or user preferences.

# Key Features
**NLP Techniques:**
Utilizes NLP for text preprocessing, tokenization, and vectorization of course descriptions or user queries.

**Cosine Similarity:** 
Implements cosine similarity to measure the similarity between course descriptions or user queries, 
recommending courses with the highest similarity scores.

**Scalability:** 
Designed to handle large datasets of courses and user interactions efficiently, ensuring scalability as the 
number of courses and users grows.
